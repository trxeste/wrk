Network/HTTP/Date/Converter.hs:4:1: Warning:
    The import of `Control.Applicative' is redundant
      except perhaps to import instances from `Control.Applicative'
    To import instances alone, use: import Control.Applicative()

Network/HTTP/Date/Converter.hs:61:19: Warning:
    In the use of `inlinePerformIO'
    (imported from Data.ByteString.Internal):
    Deprecated: "If you think you know what you are doing, use 'unsafePerformIO'. If you are sure you know what you are doing, use 'unsafeDupablePerformIO'. If you enjoy sharing an address space with a malevolent agent of chaos, try 'accursedUnutterablePerformIO'."
